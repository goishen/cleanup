Whew.  Learned about the OS module, learned about shutil module, learned about try/except blocks.  Learned how to shorten up the code with .endswith, and having that be a tuple.  

Please, forget about the "else:" block here, because I realize that will always print out "Nothing To Do".  Also I realize that the labels have to be cleared before printing something else to them, probably with another label.  

My thinking was to create a cyclical motion through all of the files that it had moved.  Kind of like Windows did back in the day.   I guess Linux did it too.   *shrug*   But that's a problem we can deal with tomorrow.
